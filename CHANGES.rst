``persistent`` Changelog
========================

4.2.3 (unreleased)
------------------

- Fix the hashcode of Python ``TimeStamp`` objects on 64-bit Python on
  Windows. See https://github.com/zopefoundation/persistent/pull/55

- Stop calling ``gc.collect`` every time ``PickleCache.incrgc`` is called (every
  transaction boundary) in pure-Python mode (PyPy). This means that
  the reported size of the cache may be wrong (until the next GC), but
  it is much faster. This should not have any observable effects for
  user code.


4.2.2 (2016-11-29)
------------------

- Drop use of ``ctypes`` for determining maximum integer size, to increase
  pure-Python compatibility. See https://github.com/zopefoundation/persistent/pull/31

- Ensure that ``__slots__`` attributes are cleared when a persistent
  object is ghostified.  (This excluses classes that override
  ``__new__``.  See
  https://github.com/zopefoundation/persistent/wiki/Notes_on_state_new_and_slots
  if you're curious.)

4.2.1 (2016-05-26)
------------------

- Fix the hashcode of C ``TimeStamp`` objects on 64-bit Python 3 on
  Windows.

4.2.0 (2016-05-05)
------------------

- Fixed the Python(/PYPY) implementation ``TimeStamp.timeTime`` method
  to have subsecond precision.

- When testing ``PURE_PYTHON`` environments under ``tox``, avoid poisoning
  the user's global wheel cache.

- Add support for Python 3.5.

- Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.

4.1.1 (2015-06-02)
------------------

- Fix manifest and re-upload to fix stray files included in 4.1.0.

4.1.0 (2015-05-19)
------------------

- Make the Python implementation of ``Persistent`` and ``PickleCache``
  behave more similarly to the C implementation. In particular, the
  Python version can now run the complete ZODB and ZEO test suites.

- Fix the hashcode of the Python ``TimeStamp`` on 32-bit platforms.

4.0.9 (2015-04-08)
------------------

- Make the C and Python ``TimeStamp`` objects behave more alike. The
  Python version now produces the same ``repr`` and ``.raw()`` output as
  the C version, and has the same hashcode. In addition, the Python
  version is now supports ordering and equality like the C version.

- Intern keys of object state in ``__setstate__`` to reduce memory usage
  when unpickling multiple objects with the same attributes.

- Add support for PyPy3.

- 100% branch coverage.

4.0.8 (2014-03-20)
------------------

- Add support for Python 3.4.

- In pure-Python ``Persistent``, avoid loading state in ``_p_activate``
  for non-ghost objects (which could corrupt their state).  (PR #9)

- In pure-Python, and don't throw ``POSKeyError`` if ``_p_activate`` is
  called on an object that has never been committed.  (PR #9)

- In pure-Python ``Persistent``, avoid calling a subclass's ``__setattr__``
  at instance creation time. (PR #8)

- Make it possible to delete ``_p_jar`` / ``_p_oid`` of a pure-Python
  ``Persistent`` object which has been removed from the jar's cache
  (fixes aborting a ZODB Connection that has added objects). (PR #7)

4.0.7 (2014-02-20)
------------------

- Avoid a KeyError from ``_p_accessed()`` on newly-created objects under
  pure-Python:  these objects may be assigned to a jar, but not yet added
  to its cache.  (PR #6)

- Avoid a failure in ``Persistent.__setstate__`` when the state dict
  contains exactly two keys.  (PR #5)

- Fix a hang in ``picklecache`` invalidation if OIDs are manually passed
  out-of-order. (PR #4)

- Add ``PURE_PYTHON`` environment variable support:  if set, the C
  extensions will not be built, imported, or tested.


4.0.6 (2013-01-03)
------------------

- Updated Trove classifiers.


4.0.5 (2012-12-14)
------------------

- Fixed the C-extensions under Py3k (previously they compiled but were
  not importable).


4.0.4 (2012-12-11)
------------------

- Added support for Python 3.3.

- C extenstions now build under Python 3.2, passing the same tests as
  the pure-Python reference implementation.

4.0.3 (2012-11-19)
------------------

- Fixed: In the C implimentation, an integer was compared with a
  pointer, with undefined results and a compiler warning.

- Fixed: the Python implementation of the ``_p_estimated_size`` propety
  didn't support deletion.

- Simplified implementation of the ``_p_estimated_size`` property to
  only accept integers.  A TypeError is raised if an incorrect type is
  provided.


4.0.2 (2012-08-27)
------------------

- Correct initialization functions in renamed ``_timestamp`` extension.


4.0.1 (2012-08-26)
------------------

- Worked around test failure due to overflow to long on 32-bit systems.

- Renamed ``TimeStamp`` extension module to avoid clash with pure-Python
  ``timestamp`` module on case-insensitive filesystems.

  N.B:  the canonical way to import the ``TimeStamp`` class is now::

    from persistent.timestamp import TimeStamp

  which will yield the class from the extension module (if available),
  falling back to the pure-Python reference implementation.


4.0.0 (2012-08-11)
------------------

Platform Changes
################

- Added explicit support for Python 3.2 and PyPy.

  - Note that the C implementations of Persistent, PickleCache, and Timestamp
    are not built (yet) on these platforms.

- Dropped support for Python < 2.6.

Testing Changes
###############

- 100% unit test coverage.

- Removed all ``ZODB``-dependent tests:

  - Rewrote some to avoid the dependency

  - Cloned the remainder into new ``ZODB.tests`` modules.

- Refactored some doctests refactored as unittests.

- Completed pure-Python reference implementations of 'Persistent',
  'PickleCache', and 'TimeStamp'.

- All covered platforms tested under ``tox``.

- Added support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.

- Added ``setup.py dev`` alias (installs ``nose`` and ``coverage``).

- Dropped dependency on ``zope.testing`` / ``zope.testrunner``:  tests now
  run with ``setup.py test``.

Documentation Changes
#####################

- Refactored many Doctests as Sphinx documentation (snippets are exercised
  via 'tox').

- Added ``setup.py docs`` alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and
  ``repoze.sphinx.autointerface``).
